# raspberry-pi-sorting-hat
Are you a Harry Potter Fan? Want to find out which house you're in?

This is a program that works like a sorting hat, picking a random house and saying it.
We used a:
1. Raspberry Pi
2. A battery 
3. A bluetooth speaker 
4. A Grove Pi 
5. An ultrasonic sensor 
6. A model of a sorting hat. 

This is the raspberry pi which is a mini computer that runs code. It is attacted to a Grove Pi, which is what we used to connect our sensors.
